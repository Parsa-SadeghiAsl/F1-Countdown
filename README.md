    ```

## üì¶ Building for Production (APK)

To build a signed, production-ready APK, follow these steps:

1.  **Generate a private signing key:**
    ```sh
    cd android/app
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore f1-countdown-key.keystore -alias f1-countdown-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

2.  **Set up your Gradle variables** by adding your key's password and alias to the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file.
3.  **Add the signing configuration** to your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
4.  **Generate the release build:**
    ```sh
    cd android
    ./gradlew assembleRelease
    ```
    The final APK will be located at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`.
